Unfortunately the Obsidian wikilinks with different display text, written like this `[[title|Display text]]` between double brackets, doesnâ€™t convert well with Jekyll. I have not yet figured out how to fix this with plugins, but will for now use the following formatting: `[display text](/permalink)`.
