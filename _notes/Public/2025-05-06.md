Decided I will not be using `posts`, but only `notes`. This way I can make use of the wikilinks throughout all notes and have them also show up in the RSS feed.

For this I added a custom feed.xml file, and changed the `feed: hide/show` property to `feed: false/true`.

Now I can also have just the `_notes` folder open in the Obsidian vault as I'll be doing all my writing in there. If I want to add a page, I will just have to move it manually â€“ but here it's also good to consider if a page is needed, [or whether I can just use notes?](/only-notes)

Just came across a new error regarding the link above: I cannot use a different display text right now. [[How to write wikilinks with alternative display text]]?
